## Interesting piece of code
```java
        System.out.println("(Type 'X' if you want to cancel and return to Home)" );

        System.out.print("Description: ");
        String description = scanner.nextLine();
        if (description.equalsIgnoreCase("X")) {
            simulateLoading("Deposit cancelled. Returning to Home...");
            return;
        }
```
